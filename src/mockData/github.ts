    Three days ago, I started a launch that resulted in: 
    200 stars
    60 newsletter registration
    I want to say that the launch was super diverse, and many channels helped out. But the truth is, one channel performed 10x better than all the others: DEV.TO `,

      "Getting into the GitHub trending feed is the dream, especially in higher places. In Novu, we were trending on the top spot for almost a week and got around 7000 stars. You immediately rush with tons of stars, contributors, and Discord members when you are there. The success of many companies relies on this feed. ",

    description: `The Gitroom platform is the best tool for scheduling your open-source launches, and of course, you can also self-host it. 
    The primary strategy I used for Novu and every person I talk to is “launches.” A weekly spirit of promoting your platform in every possible channel and push to be trending over GitHub. 
    However, my main problem was that I could never plan my launch ahead. I had to do it manually during the week. Why?
    But the truth is that only more prominent brands enjoy that (mostly). In Taipy, we have been wildly trying to put our name everywhere, but most of the Reactions we get are: “That’s interesting” or “What’s the difference between you and your competitors?” Taipy is not an established brand—but we will get there. `,
